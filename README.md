SQL Data Analysis Project

This project showcases a series of SQL queries designed to analyze data from a pizza sales database. The analysis includes:

- Total number of orders placed.
- Total revenue generated from pizza sales.
- Identification of the highest-priced pizza.
- Most common pizza size ordered.
- Top 5 most ordered pizza types with quantities.
- Total quantity of each pizza category ordered.
- Distribution of orders by hour of the day.
- Average number of pizzas ordered per day.
- Top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.
- Percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.

Each query demonstrates key SQL skills including joins, grouping, and aggregation. This project is an excellent resource for anyone looking to understand practical applications of SQL in data analysis.
